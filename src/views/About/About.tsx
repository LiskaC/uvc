    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      We are a volunteer-run organisation of Ukrainians and friends of Ukraine based in Scotland,
      united by a simple mission: to work for Ukrainian victory. We bring forward the voices of one
      of the most vulnerable groups in Ukraine - Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs), and stand in
      support of Ukraine‚Äôs Defenders. We raise awareness, mobilise support, and direct funds to have
      impact in critical areas.
    </p>
    <h2>üìñ Our story</h2>
    <p>
      Our journey began on 16 September 2023, when we held a meeting of all the active Ukrainian
      volunteer organisations and activists from across Edinburgh at the Consulate of Ukraine. From
      that meeting, we established a working group of around 30 dedicated activists, focussed on
      raising awareness about the ongoing violations of human rights of Ukrainian POWs.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>From that moment, our campaign grew.</p>
    <h2>‚úä Building a movement</h2>
    <p>
      Our weekly demonstrations brought together newly arrived to Scotland Ukrainians eager to help
      their homeland from abroad, and the local community keen to support and learn more about
      Ukraine. These gatherings became not only a form of demonstration but also a meeting place, a
      community, and a bridge between Scotland and Ukraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing beyond the demonstrations, we developed a unique platform that brings voices from
      Ukraine directly to the Scottish public. Together, we have organised a wide range of engaging,
      open to the public events touching on important topics that arose from the war in Ukraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the war takes, we are working to save, preserve and grow - acting as a vital link of
      communication between those on and beyond the frontline, and the public here in Scotland.
    </p>
    <h2>üåç Connecting communities</h2>
    <p>
      Through our efforts in Edinburgh, we‚Äôve connected Scotland with diverse Ukrainian communities
      not only in Ukraine but around the world. By joining collaborative actions and representing
      Edinburgh and Scotland, we bring forward Scotland‚Äôs distinctive voice, values, and solidarity.
    </p>
    <h2>üí™ Why We Do It</h2>
    <p>
      We may be far from the frontlines, but we know that every action matters. Whether it‚Äôs a pound
      donated, a public protest attended, or a conversation with a stranger, we believe that
      consistent, visible solidarity can change minds ‚Äî and save lives.
